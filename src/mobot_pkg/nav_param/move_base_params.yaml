# Parameters related to the local controller.
controller_frequency: 5.0  # The frequency (Hz) at which the local controller tries to update the robot's velocity.
controller_patience: 5.0   # How long (seconds) the controller will wait without receiving a valid velocity command before giving up.

# Parameters related to the global planner.
planner_frequency: 10.0  # The frequency (Hz) at which the global planner tries to plan a path to the goal.
planner_patience: 5.0    # How long (seconds) the planner will wait for a valid plan before triggering a planning failure.

# Distance from an obstacle at which move_base will try to unstuck itself by resetting costmaps.
conservative_reset_dist: .02  # Specifies the distance (meters) from an obstacle at which move_base will try to unstuck itself.
